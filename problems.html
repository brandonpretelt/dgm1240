                    <h2> Match Mental Model </h2>
                    <h3> Overview </h3>
                    <p> Here is an overview of the problems identified. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The site is fairly easy and standard to use. Aside from a few things, it's your standard
                            e-commerce site.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There is no account feature. I think that would help this site progress.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In order to have better consistency with other systems, I think that the menu would be
                            better positioned up on the top right or something of the sort. On mobile, a hamburger menu
                            would be ideal.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I like that search is where it is expected.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                </article>

                <article class="large-6">
                    <h3> In Depth </h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/main-page-tcm.png" alt="image of ecommerce website">
                        <figcaption> Nothing to difficult to use, standard e-commerce site. </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Search is in a good place but, I think it would be more beneficial to get rid of the line
                        that is
                        separating the top menu from the rest of the content. </p>


                    <p>That side menu, while being a decent place for it, I think would be better up top to better
                        other
                        systems. It can help keep with consistency that a majority of people expect from using a
                        website.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/topmenu.png" alt="top menu">
                        <figcaption>In my prototype, the menu is at the top where it is usually expected to be.
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>






                    <p>In this design, I also have a bit of a problem with where the menu is placed on mobile.</p>

                    <p>In my tests, I found that it was a bit more cumbersome to have it placed in the middle of the
                        page like and it takes up some real estate.</p>


                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/topmenu-mobile-not.png" alt="menu in the middle">
                        <figcaption>It is placed in kind of an unexpected place</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>I propose to change it to the below. The menu right up next to the cart. This has more of a
                        consistent feel and helps match up with other more familiar systems.</p>
                    <div class="figureWrapper">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/topmenu-mobile.png" alt="top right menu">
                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>




                    <p> In my prototype, the menu bar does not have that horizontal rule at all </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/prototype.png" alt="example of my top menu">
                        <figcaption> No horizontal rule and there is a login function </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Something else I have noticed in my evalution is that there is no "my account" feature. I
                        feel
                        like this website would benefit from it because the user would have a place to keep
                        everything
                        stored.</p>
                    <p>Here is a rough idea of what the account page would like: </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/account-page.png" alt="example of my top menu">
                        <figcaption> Account Page </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Other features of this page would include moving the order tracking link here, custom sizing
                        chart and shipping rates.</p>

<!--
<li>
    <p> Under this principle, I found that the site is easy to use. It works as expected on both
        desktop
        and mobile devices. So, no issues here. </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p> Now, since this site is an ecommerce website, I think that it would be nice if it had an
        account
        feature. I say this because it would be nice to go back and look at previous orders,
        have a
        place to save my payment methods and have the opportunity to be able to discounts
        through an
        email campaign of sorts.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>I noticed there is a search menu. While I do think it is a nice addition and is in a good
        spot,
        I'm not sure if it necessary given the nature of the website. Not too much inventory to
        search
        through. I propose getting rid of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>While browsing the site, I find that the navigation is a bit non-convential. I think
        having it up
        at the top in the header would be appropriate on desktop screens and behind a hamburger
        menu on
        mobile devices.</p>
