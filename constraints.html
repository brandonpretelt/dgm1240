                    <h2>Account for User & Environmental Constraints</h2>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p> Here is an overview of the problems identified. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Search button needs to be larger (44px minimum) or search bar needs to expand on mobile.
                        </li>
                        <li>The
                            touch/click target for search is
                            not easily defined.</li>
                        <li>
                            On mobile, the search button should absolutely not take the user onto a completely new page.
                        </li>

                    </ol>

                </article>
                <article class="large-6">
                    <h3> In Depth </h3>
                    <figure class="clearfix">
                        <img src="images/search-bar-smartphone.png" alt="image of ecommerce website"
                            class="mobile smartphone-example">
                        <img src="images/search-bar.png" alt="image of ecommerce website" class="mobile tablet-example">
                        <figcaption> This search icon is a little too small for a touch target on tablets and
                            smartphones. </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>While I was testing this, the search icon was hard to "hit" because of how small it is. It
                        is not at the recommended 44px for a touch target.</p>

                    <p>I also found the smartphone search experience to be lacking. I think that a better way to handle
                        search on smartphones is to have the search bar expand. And to position the search bar below the
                        menu and headline. </p>

                    <p>The search bar should not be directing the user to a different page. A better approach would be
                        to have the search bar be persistent, a la Google Search.</p>

                            <figcaption> The search bar should be persistent on smartphones.</figcaption>

                        </figure>
                    </div>


                    <p> The search experience on desktop can also be enhanced. I think it should be done by having an
                        onclick state. Click on the icon to reveal the search box and then click again to exit out of it
                        if the search was not intended. </p>

<!--
<li>
    <p> Under this principle, I found that the site is easy to use. It works as expected on both
        desktop
        and mobile devices. So, no issues here. </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p> Now, since this site is an ecommerce website, I think that it would be nice if it had an
        account
        feature. I say this because it would be nice to go back and look at previous orders,
        have a
        place to save my payment methods and have the opportunity to be able to discounts
        through an
        email campaign of sorts.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>I noticed there is a search menu. While I do think it is a nice addition and is in a good
        spot,
        I'm not sure if it necessary given the nature of the website. Not too much inventory to
        search
        through. I propose getting rid of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>While browsing the site, I find that the navigation is a bit non-convential. I think
        having it up
        at the top in the header would be appropriate on desktop screens and behind a hamburger
        menu on
        mobile devices.</p>
