                    <h2>Problem: </h2>
                    <p>I decided to do a review on <a href="https://thecannonsmouth.com" target="_blank">this site</a>.
                        As I was
                        reviewing the
                        site, I found a few potential usability issues that I would like to address the owner. I used
                        the following principles to run my evaluation. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="problems.html">Match Mental Model</a></li>
                        <li><a href="constraints.html">Account for User & Environmental Constarits</a></li>

                    <h2>Process: </h2>
                    <p>My process was to go through the site, identify areas of attention using the 2 of the heuristics
                        that are mentioned above. By concentrating on those, I was able to find some problem areas and
                        put together a small prototype of my changes that would, in my opinion, improve the user
                        experience of this design.</p>

                <article class="large-6">
                    <h2>Decisions: </h2>
                    <p>Some of the decisions that I made were based on methods that I have learned in various classes
                        that I have taken at UVU. </p>
                    <p>The reasonings behind why I did what I did are on the appropriate pages for the two heuristics
                        that I ran.</p>
                    <p>Some aspects of this design did not really meet up to what I think should be a focus in UX.</p>

                    <h2>Outcome: </h2>
                    <p>The outcome? Well, I haven't completely finished the complete analysis. I still have a few things
                        here and there to take care of.</p>
                    <p>My next steps are to go back and revise a few key points in this design that I missed. I will
                        probably meet with the owner of this site and see if there's anything that he would like to see
                        done. I will try to run a full usability test on the website if permitted.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection: </h2>
                    <p>What went well? Definitely the prototypes that I put together. I have a few that I would like to
                        show the owner and see if he would implment them.</p>
                    <p>What didn't go well? I had originally thought that a website such as this would have a few more
                        usability problems but, I was wrong. I think that the next time I do something like this, I
                        would find a bigger project to take on.</p>
                    <p>The biggest failure to this whole project, for me, was the simple fact that some of the software
                        I was trying to use to build the documentation itself did not want to cooperate with the design
                        that I was trying to implement</p>

                    <p> Here is an overview of the problems identified. Click <a href="problems.html#match">here</a> to
                        view a
                        more in

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The site is fairly easy and standard to use. Aside from a few things, it's your standard
                            e-commerce site.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There is no account feature. I think that would help this site progress.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In order to have better consistency with other systems, I think that the menu would be
                            better positioned up on the top right or something of the sort. On mobile, a hamburger menu
                            would be ideal.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I like that search is where it is expected.
                        </li>

                            The search text decoration and cart should be removed. The touch/click target for search is

                        <li>
                            On mobile, the search button should absolutely not take the user onto a completely new page.

                            Sidebar menu is a nice touch but, I would rather have it up at the top and move some links
                            (policies & terms, sizing chart) down to the footer

                            Search button needs to be larger (44px minimum) or search bar needs to expand on mobile.

                            <p> Under this principle, I found that the site is easy to use. It works as expected on both
                                desktop
                                and mobile devices. So, no issues here. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> Now, since this site is an ecommerce website, I think that it would be nice if it had an
                                account
                                feature. I say this because it would be nice to go back and look at previous orders,
                                have a
                                place to save my payment methods and have the opportunity to be able to discounts
                                through an
                                email campaign of sorts.</p>
